# OPDSfoldersync - Koreader OPDS Plugin with Per-Catalog Sync

This project provides an enhanced OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) plugin for Koreader, enabling users to browse, download, and synchronize content from OPDS catalogs. A key feature of this plugin is the ability to configure *per-catalog synchronization folders*, allowing for more organized management of downloaded books and documents.

## Features

*   **Automated Synchronization:** Keep your catalogs synced automatically with periodic and event-based triggers (e.g., on network connection or resume).
*   **Per-Catalog Sync Folders:** Assign a dedicated synchronization directory for each OPDS catalog, preventing clutter and improving organization of your downloaded files. Falls back to a global sync directory if not set per-catalog.
*   **Include/Exclude Filters:** Fine-tune your syncs by setting include or exclude filters for authors and categories on a per-catalog basis.

## Installation

This plugin **replaces and extends** the default OPDS plugin that comes with Koreader. To avoid conflicts, you must remove the original before installing this version.

1.  **Locate your Koreader installation directory.** This is typically where your `koreader.app` or `koreader.sh` executable resides.
2.  **Navigate to the `plugins` directory** within your Koreader installation (e.g., `/koreader/plugins/`).
3.  **Delete the existing `opds.koplugin` directory.** This step is crucial to ensure the new plugin loads correctly.
4.  **Copy the `opds.koplugin` folder** from this repository directly into Koreader's `plugins` directory.
    *   Make sure you copy the entire `opds.koplugin` directory, not just its contents.

Your directory structure should look something like this:

```
/koreader/
├── plugins/
│   ├── opds.koplugin/
│   │   ├── _meta.lua
│   │   ├── main.lua
│   │   ├── opdsbrowser.lua
│   │   ├── opdsparser.lua
│   │   └── opdspse.lua
│   └── (other plugins...)
├── (other Koreader files...)
```

5.  **Restart Koreader** to load the new plugin.

## Usage

### Adding/Editing an OPDS Catalog

1.  From the Koreader file browser, access the **"Network"** menu (usually a Wi-Fi or globe icon).
2.  Select **"OPDS"**.
3.  Choose **"Add new catalog"** or select an existing catalog and choose **"Edit catalog"**.
4.  Fill in the catalog details (Name, URL, Username, Password).
5.  **Sync Catalog:** Check this option if you want Koreader to automatically synchronize content from this catalog.
6.  **Set Sync Folder:** A new button labeled "Set sync folder" (or "Sync folder: [path]" if already set) will allow you to choose a specific directory on your device where books from *this catalog* will be downloaded. If left unset, the global sync folder or default download directory will be used.
7.  Tap **"Save"**.

### Filtering

You can control which books are synced from a catalog by setting filters for authors and categories. These filters can be accessed when adding or editing a catalog.

*   **Excluded Authors/Categories:** A comma-separated list of authors or categories to exclude from synchronization.
*   **Included Authors/Categories:** A comma-separated list of authors or categories to include in synchronization. If this is set, only items that match will be synced.

**Filter Precedence:**

The include and exclude filters work together to give you fine-grained control. Here's how they interact:

| Included Authors/Categories | Excluded Authors/Categories | Behavior                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not Set                     | Not Set                     | All books from the catalog are synced.                                                                                                |
| Not Set                     | Set                         | All books are synced, *except* those matching the excluded authors/categories.                                                        |
| Set                         | Not Set                     | Only books matching the included authors/categories are synced.                                                                       |
| Set                         | Set                         | Only books matching the included authors/categories are considered. From that set, any books matching the excluded list are removed. |

For example, if you include the category "Science Fiction" and exclude the author "John Doe", you will get all science fiction books except for those written by John Doe.

### Automated Synchronization

This plugin now supports automated synchronization to keep your library up-to-date without manual intervention.

*   **How it Works:** When enabled, auto-sync will periodically check for new content in your synced catalogs. By default, this check occurs every 24 hours.
*   **Event-Based Triggers:** In addition to the periodic sync, the plugin will also trigger a sync when:
    *   Your device connects to a network.
    *   Your device resumes from sleep.
*   **Configuration:** You can manage auto-sync directly from the OPDS catalog menu:
    *   **Auto-sync: On/Off:** Toggle the automated synchronization feature. It is enabled by default.
    *   **Last sync:** Displays the date and time of the last successful synchronization.

### Synchronization

*   When "Sync Catalog" is enabled for a catalog, Koreader will attempt to download new items from that catalog into its designated sync folder.
*   The plugin prioritizes the per-catalog sync folder. If not set, it falls back to the global `sync_dir` setting (if configured in Koreader settings), and finally to Koreader's default download directory.
*   **Max sync size:** Controls how many books can be queued per sync cycle (default: 50). If your largest catalog has more books than this limit, increase it via "Set max number of files to sync" in the OPDS menu. This is a per-cycle cap — it doesn't pre-allocate anything and has no cost when the catalog is already up to date.
*   **Download progress:** During sync and batch downloads, a progress indicator shows "Downloading X of Y" so you always know where you are.
*   **Safe cancellation:** Tapping the progress message prompts a "Stop downloading?" confirmation. Choosing "Continue" skips the current file and moves to the next; choosing "Stop" ends the session. Interrupted files are cleaned up automatically and retried on the next sync.

## Configuration

Global OPDS settings, such as a default synchronization directory for all catalogs, can typically be found within Koreader's general settings under "Network" or "OPDS". However, the per-catalog setting introduced by this plugin will override the global setting for specific catalogs.

**Note:** This plugin assumes a Koreader environment capable of running Lua plugins and accessing the file system.
